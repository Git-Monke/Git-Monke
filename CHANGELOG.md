# Changelog

## 2025-06-18

### Changed
- Updated BlogPostDisplay component to use PostWithEmbedding type directly
- Simplified BlogPostDisplay by removing redundant metadata fetching
- Improved post display performance by using pre-loaded data from context

### Fixed
- Embedding generation (both build and browser) now strips all markdown and non-text characters (except basic grammar) before encoding for improved semantic accuracy.

### Changed
- Embeddings are now generated per chunk (40â€“80 words) instead of per entire post, improving semantic search for phrase-level queries.
- `PostWithEmbedding.embedding` type changed from `number[]` to `number[][]` to reflect chunked embeddings.
- Search now uses the highest similarity from all chunk embeddings for each post.
- Each post now includes a `content` field containing only meaningful, non-stopword tokens from the markdown body, for efficient and accurate keyword search.

### Improved
- Keyword search now uses the cleaned content field (with stopwords and markdown artifacts removed) for much higher quality results, in addition to semantic similarity.

### Added
- Implemented search-on-enter for the main search input in `App.tsx`:
  - Search now triggers only when pressing Enter in the input field.
  - The input field clears itself after searching.
- Implemented semantic search functionality:
  - Added cosine similarity search using post embeddings
  - Integrated with @xenova/transformers for real-time query embedding
  - Added similarity threshold filtering for better results
  - Added loading state for search operations

- Enhanced usePosts hook with improved state management:
  - Added filteredEntries state for search results
  - Added selectedPost state for tracking selected posts
  - Implemented basic search filtering by title, description, and tags
  - Added proper TypeScript types and error handling

- Created `HomeHeader` component with a large, centered title ("Jacob Velasquez"), tagline, prominent search bar (styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui conventions), and a placeholder area for blog posts.
- Updated `App.tsx` to render the new `HomeHeader` as the main content.
- Added a TypeScript build script (`build/index.ts`) to process blog post markdown files for semantic encoding.
- Modularized embedding logic into `build/embedder.ts` for easy swapping of embedding models.
- Build script now generates `embeddings.json` with post metadata and semantic embeddings (excluding post content).
- Improved build script to skip posts already present in `embeddings.json` unless `--rebuild-all` is passed as a CLI argument, enabling incremental or full rebuilds.
- Recreated HomeHeader with a search bar styled to match the card background, border, and padding, and ensured it aligns in width with the blog post area.
- BlogPostCard now displays tags as capitalized Badge chips (using shadcn/ui Badge) instead of a comma-separated list.
- BlogPostCard animates the description to slide in/out on hover using Framer Motion, and only renders the description when hovered for better layout control.
- BlogPostDisplay now loads post meta from embeddings.json, strips frontmatter from markdown, and uses custom heading sizes (max 2xl) for markdown rendering.
- BlogPostDisplay renders bullet points and lists with correct styling, and the separator (hr) now has increased top and bottom margin.
- Added SelectedPostContext for global post selection, allowing BlogPostCard to set the selected post via context.
